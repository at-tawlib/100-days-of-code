# Day 018 - Turtle & the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Goals
- Understanding Turtle Graphics and How to use the Documentation
- Turtle Challenge 1 - Draw a Square
- Importing Modules, Installing Packages, and Working with Aliases
- Turtle Challenge 2 - Draw a Dashed Line
- Turtle Challenge 3 - Drawing Different Shapes
- Turtle Challenge 4 - Generate a Random Walk
- Python Tuples and How to Generate Random RGB Colours


### Activities
- Draw turtle
- Use turtle to draw a square
- Draw dashed line
- Draw different shapes:
	- Draw a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon and decagon
	- Each drawn with a random colour
	- Each side has a length of 100
	- Each shape drawn sequentially
	- Draw a Random Walk using random colours
- Use tuples to store generated random colours

## [Make a spirograph with turtle](make-spirograph)

## [Project: Make a Hirst Painting](hirst-painting)
- Extract RGB values from a Hirst image using colorgram
- Store the extracted values in a list
- Use the store color list to paint
- Paint 10 spots horizontally and vertically (in all draw 100 dots)
- Each dot should be 20 in size and space around by 50
