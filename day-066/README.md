# Day 066 - Building Your Own API with RESTful Routing
- Create a cafe API that users can get data in the form of JSON
- [Read the documentation here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25414079/2s8ZDX4i1T)
## Goals
- What is REST
- HTTP PUT vs. PATCH.
- HTTP GET - a Random Cafe
- HTTP GET - All the Cafes
- HTTP GET - Find a Cafe
- Postman - The all in one API Testing Tool
- HTTP POST - A New Cafe
- HTTP PATCH - A Cafe's Coffee Price
- HTTP DELETE - A Cafe that's Closed
- Build Documentation for Your API
