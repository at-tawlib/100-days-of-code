# Day 005 For loop
## Goals
- Using the for loop with Python Lists
- for loops and the range() function

## [Average Height](average-height.py)
a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g.  
`student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]`


Average height rounded to the nearest whole number =  **164**

### Example Input

```plaintext
156 178 165 171 187
```

### Example Output

```plaintext
171
```

## [Highest Score](highest-score.py)
a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

### Example Input

```plaintext
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
```
### Example Output

```plaintext
The highest score in the class is: 91
```

## [Adding Even numbers](add-even-numbers.py)
a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

## [FizzBuzz](fizz-buzz.py)
a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

> Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
> 
> When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
> 
> When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
> 
> And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

e.g. it might start off like this:

```plaintext
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

## Project : [Password Generator](password-generator.py)

The program will ask:
```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```
```
How many symbols would you like?
```
```
How many numbers would you like?
```
the program takes the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password
