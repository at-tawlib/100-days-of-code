# Day 005 For loop
## Goals
- Using the for loop with Python Lists
- for loops and the range() function

## Exercise 1 - Average Height
### Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g.  `student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]`

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 =  **1146**

There are a total of  **7**  heights in  `student_heights`

1146 รท 7 =  **163.71428571428572**

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number =  **164**

**Important**  You should not use the  `sum()`  or  `len()`  functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

### Example Input

```plaintext
156 178 165 171 187
```

In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

### Example Output

```plaintext
171
```


## Exercise 2 - Highest Score
### Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g.  `student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

**Important**  you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

> `The highest score in the class is: x`

### Example Input

```plaintext
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
```

In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like:  `[78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]`

### Example Output

```plaintext
The highest score in the class is: 91
```

## Exercis 3 - Adding Even numbers
### Instructions

You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

## Exercise 4 - FizzBuzz
### Instructions

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

> Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
> 
> When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
> 
> When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
> 
> And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

e.g. it might start off like this:

```plaintext
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```

## Project : Password Generator

## Instructions

The program will ask:
```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```
```
How many symbols would you like?
```
```
How many numbers would you like?
```
The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. Use your knowledge about Python lists and loops to complete the challenge. 

## Easy Version (Step 1)

Generate the password in sequence. If the user wants 
* 4 letters
* 2 symbols and
* 3 numbers

then the password might look like this: 

```
fgdx$*924
```
You can see that all the letters are together. All the symbols are together and all the numbers follow each other as well. Try to solve this problem first. 

## Hard Version (Step 2)

When you've completed the easy version, you're ready to tackle the hard version. In the advanced version of this project the final password does not follow a pattern. So the example above might look like this:
```
x$d24g*f9
```
And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
