## Exercise 2 - BMI Calculator

### Instructions

Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**Warning**  you should convert the result to a whole number.

### Example Input

```plaintext
weight = 80
height = 1.75
```

### Example Output

```plaintext
80 Ã· (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

## Exercise 3 - Life in Weeks

### Instructions

I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

[https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html)

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

**Warning**  your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

### Example Input

```plaintext
56
```

### Example Output

```plaintext
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
```

## Project - Tip Calculator

## Instructions

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.

Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª


## Example Input

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
```

## Example Output

```
Each person should pay: $19.93
```
